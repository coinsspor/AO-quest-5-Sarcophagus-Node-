# Sarcophagus Node Integration with AO Terminal

This guide will help you set up a Sarcophagus Node and integrate it with the AO Terminal to bond processes and send results back to the terminal.

## Prerequisites

1. **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your server.
2. **Docker**: Docker must be installed and running on your server.
3. **AO Terminal**: Set up an AO terminal on your server.
4. **Sarcophagus Node**: Follow the [Sarcophagus Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/sarcophagus-org/quickstart-archaeologist).

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Set Up the Sarcophagus Node

First, set up the Sarcophagus Node by following the instructions in the [Sarcophagus Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/sarcophagus-org/quickstart-archaeologist).

### Step 2: Clone Your Repository

Clone your repository that contains the necessary files.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/sarcophagus-ao.git
cd sarcophagus-ao

```
### Step 3: Add Custom Scripts
Create the following custom scripts in your project directory. Below are the descriptions and purposes of each script:

**proxy_server.js**
This script sets up a WebSocket server to handle bonding requests and send results back to the AO Terminal. It manages the communication between the Sarcophagus node and the AO Terminal.

**client.lua**
This script handles incoming bonding requests and initiates the bonding process. It processes the messages received from the AO Terminal and performs the necessary actions.

**send.js**
This script is used to send messages from the bonding process back to the AO Terminal. It ensures that the results of the bonding process are communicated back to the AO Terminal.

### Step 4: Running the Scripts

Follow these steps to run the scripts:

Start the WebSocket server:

```
node proxy_server.js

```
Ensure the AO Terminal is listening for incoming messages. Make sure the AO Terminal is properly configured to receive messages.

### Step 5: Verification

Verify that your Sarcophagus node is properly integrated with the AO Terminal by checking the AO Terminal for messages and ensuring that the bonding process works correctly.

**Summary**
By following these steps, you will have set up a Sarcophagus node integrated with the AO Terminal. The provided scripts will handle the bonding process and ensure that results are communicated back to the AO Terminal.
